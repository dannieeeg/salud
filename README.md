# salud
salud! is a safe space where your cocktail preference is the top priority. 
The idea is that once registered, guests will go through a simple questionnarie that will expand our knowledge on their cocktails of choice.
Whether registered or not, there will be a page for Featured Happy Hours of the week. These Featured Happy Hours will be chosen from users that have already registered and have checked into the specified location. Most recent reviews will be fed underneath a screenshot of the featured happy hour. 
Users will also have access to a newsletter.
